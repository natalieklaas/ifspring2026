                <p class = "man">It's a human sign</p>
                <p class = "man">When things go wrong</p>
                <p class = "man">When the scent of her lingers</p>
                <p class = "man" id="endParagraph"> And temptation's strong</p>
            
                <p class = "man">Cold, cold heart</p>
                <p class = "man">Hardened by you (oh)</p>
                <p class = "man">Some things looking better, baby</p>
                <p class = "man" id="endParagraph">Just passing through (no, no, no, no, no)</p>
            
                <p class = "woman">And I think it's gonna be a long, long time</p>
                <p class = "woman">'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find</p>
                <p class = "woman">I'm not the man they think I am at home</p>
                <p class = "woman">Oh, no, no, no</p>
                <p class = "woman">And this is what I should have said</p>
