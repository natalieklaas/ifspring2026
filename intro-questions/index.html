        <h1>My Intro Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Name: Natalie Klaas, Major: Business and Computer Science, Year: Semior</li>
            <li>I am taking this class as an elective for my HCI minor. This class sounded helpful to connect my business and computer science sides. </li>
            <li>I have used HTML/CSS/JS in my internship two years ago and in my web design class. </li>
            <li>I want to learn what the best design choices to make are. </li>
            <li>Designing for a screen might be different from paper because it has to be able to flex to fit any screen size. </li>
            <li>I like the Aritzia website design, because I feel like it makes the brand feel like it is more high end, with a lot of clean lines and neutrals.  https://www.aritzia.com/us/en/clothing. </li>
            <li>I like the Geeks for Geeks website communication, because I can tell what every button does and it is super easy to navigate. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org . </li>
            <li>The New York Times website works well. It is sectioned out well and has a simple but interesting design. https://www.nytimes.com </li>
